# Ant-colony-algorithm
We use the behavior of nature, in this case the ants' pheromones, to optimize a route designated by a graph.
In the graph we can see how the starting city (A) and the destination city (D) look visually.

We see that the proposed graph is somewhat simple, but the code allows adding more cities and also allows choosing the start city and the destination city.
